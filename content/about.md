A few things about me:

* I'm a soprano 1 in the UVA University Singers and went on a European tour with this group (video coming soon?)
* I'm the chair of the ACM Chapter at UVA
* I interned at Amazon in my sophomore year, and I still miss Seattle
* I directed the 7th annual High School Programming Contest at UVA
* I went on a service trip to Haiti and can't wait to go back!
* J'apprends le francais maintenant, et je l'aime :)
