Currently, I work as a Research Assistant under [Westley Weimer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/) and [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). My project lies at the intersection of Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and Security. In this project, I use NLP and Machine Learning methods to hide coding style so that the author's fingerprint is hidden, but tampering is non-evident. 

**Other Projects:**

* I wrote a **compiler** that compiles COOL (an object-oriented language) down to x86
* I also wrote an **interpreter** for the same language
* During my internship at Amazon, I developed new APIs for a Seller Enforcement Service and created a user interface for it
