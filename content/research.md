Currently, I work as a Research Assistant under [Westley Weimer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/) and [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). My project lies at the intersection of Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and Security. In this project, I use NLP and Machine Learning methods to hide coding style so that the author's fingerprint is hidden, but tampering is non-evident.
