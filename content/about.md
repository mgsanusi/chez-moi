If I'm not studying, holding office hours, or doing research, I'm probably singing! Below are some useless facts about me and the awards and honors that I've won during my time at UVA.

* I'm a soprano 1 in the UVA University Singers and went on a European tour with this group (video coming soon?)
* I'm the chair of the ACM Chapter at UVA
* I interned at Amazon in my sophomore year, and I still miss Seattle
* I directed the 7th annual High School Programming Contest at UVA
* I went on a service trip to Haiti and can't wait to go back!
* J'apprends le francais maintenant, et je l'aime :)
* I've recently taken up rock climbing

**awards and honors:**

* Radar Award for Service at UVA, 2016
* Intermediate Honors, UVA
* Dean's List at UVA, all semesters
